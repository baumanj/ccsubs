Hi <%= @acceptee.name %>,

<%= @accepter.name %> has accepted your offer to swap with you for their <%= @req %> shift. In exchange, they solemly swear to cover your <%= @req.fulfilling_swap %> shift. That's it!

Just a reminder: if for some reason you later can't do <%= @req %>, you are responsible for finding coverage.

Thank you; come again.
