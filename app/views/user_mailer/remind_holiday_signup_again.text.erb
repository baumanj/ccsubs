Hello again!

This is your second reminder that <%= @holiday %> is coming up and still needs more help on the following <%= "shift".pluralize(@shifts.size) %>:
<% @shifts.each do |shift| %>
â€¢ <%= shift %>
<% end %>

Part of your volunteer commitment includes at least one holiday shift per year, so if you can help, please sign up here: <%= @url %>.

You are receiving this reminder because you haven't signed up online for a holiday shift in the past year<%= '*' if @asterisk_text %>. Once you sign up, no more nagging for at least a year!

<%= @asterisk_text %>
