Hi <%= @accepter.name %>,

You just accepted a swap from <%= @acceptee.name %> for your <%= @req %> shift. In exchange, you solemly swear to cover their <%= @req.fulfilling_swap %> shift. Please don't forget!

Just a reminder: if for some reason you later can't do <%= @req.fulfilling_swap %>, you are responsible for finding coverage.
