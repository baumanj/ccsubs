Hey <%= @on_call.user %>,
You have successfully signed up for on-call for <%= @on_call %>. Thank you!

Please add this shift to your personal calendar as a firm commitment. We only call you in if a regular shift member is sick or has an emergency but need to count on your help if that happens. If you have not received a call from the phone room 45 minutes into the on-call shift time you signed up for, you are free to assume that you are not needed!
